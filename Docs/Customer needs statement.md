## Snuffledorks Incorporated
Hello Brent,

We here at Snuffledorks Inc. have reviewed your samples and have decided you would be a great fit for creating our vision. Over the past year Snuffledorks employees have noticed a disconnect between our customer base and the company. We would like to re-integrate ourselves and provide a top of the line product to these customers. Snuffledorks Inc. looks forward to working with you and combining our efforts to make this vision a reality. 

Thanks,

Snuffledorks Inc. CEO

> That Lives in Bushes and Trees
> It Sleeps through the Day, On small piles of hay
> And Lives on Fishfingers and Peas
> 
> At Night when its Dark
> It plays on the Park
> And swings to and thro through the Night
> At quarter past three, its back in its Tree
> As it is quite scared of the Light
> 
> Its feathers are Blue, apart from the Tail
> Which is Purple, Green and Bright Gold
> Its Armpits are Grey and covered in hay
> And its forehead is Orange and Bold

> It flies upside down and can walk on one Leg
> And can jump up to Twenty Feet High
> Apart from one thing, it wont jump in Spring
> As this is the time that they Fly

> When Springtime arrives,look up to the skies
> A SnuffleDork, may fly overhead
> If not, look for Tree's and signs of Dried Peas
> Incase he's asleep in his Bed

***P.S.*** Below I have included an outline version of requirements that are important to us in this project.


### Purpose
Snuffledorks needs a way to reconnect with our Magic the Gathering customer base. In order to do that Snuffledorks Inc. is hiring you to create an interactive application that ultimately influences its users to purchase cards through the Snuffledorks Inc. MTG card vending division. You will have sixteen weeks from today to create this application. 

### Target Audience
The target market for this application is our Magic the Gathering player base that use our services to purchase cards for their decks. Primarily this player base is focused on the more competitive aspect of Magic the Gathering but there are those that enjoy casual or fun decks and we would like to cater to them as well. 

### Functionality
At the core of our problem Snuffledorks Inc. does not have a way for a customer to browse or search through our products. We would like the core of this application to be a database of cards that our customer base can search through and pick out the cards they would like to purchase. Of course, we would like all of the cards information to be easily readable next to a picture of the card along with our current price of the product prominently displayed next to a purchase option. 

In addition to the database of cards we want our users to be able to pick and save their chosen cards to form legal Magic the Gathering decks. We want your application to indicate when a deck is not legal and provide clear direction for the user so they can add the required cards to make the deck legal to play. There also needs to be an option to purchase a completed deck so the user does not have to go through the cards one by one to purchase but can instead do it easily in as few steps as possible. 

Snuffledorks Inc. is not well versed in managing or updating databases so your application must also include a way for Snuffledorks employees to interact with the database to make changes and add new cards as they are released. The user base must not be allowed to access this option and should be restricted to Snuffledorks employees only.
